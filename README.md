# Intro-jQuery
Introduction to jQuery

 * Module 1: Adding jQuery to web pages
During our first module, we'll discuss how jQuery helps JavaScript developers and the power it offers. We'll see how to obtain jQuery through various means, and introduce three separate editors that can be used when working with jQuery. We'll also see how to add jQuery to pages.

 We'll then investigate how to select and do basic manipulation of items on an HTML page. We'll see how you can incorporate CSS selctors to locate items on a page, as well as use various traversal methods provded by jQuery. We'll see some of the most common changes you can make to a page, such as replacing text and HTML, and adding event handlers such as click.

 * Module 2: Managing content, events and effects
Module two will begin by investigating how to manage events using jQuery. We'll talk through several events jQuery allows you to bind to. We'll see various ways to register event handlers, and ensure your code is executed at the correct time and in the correct way.

Because jQuery offers great support for manipulating and restructuring HTML pages, we'll walk through some of the various operations that can be performed to update the DOM. We'll also see how jQuery allows you to enhance the user's experience through various effects.

 * Module 3: Asynchronous operations and Ajax calls
Sometimes you will create JavaScript code that takes a longer than normal amount of time to execute. jQuery provides support for managing asynchronous calls through promises, which we'll introduce in this module. We'll also take a look at web workers, which is an HTML5 feature that allows developers to simulate threading in a browser.

When creating interactive pages, you often want to access resources on the server, typically via Ajax calls. jQuery simplifies the process for making Ajax calls, and we'll see several helper methods jQuery provides. We'll also see how you could create a server-side API that jQuery can access.
